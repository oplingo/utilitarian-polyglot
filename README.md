An interesting thing to do when you're learning languages is to estimate the amount of people you could have a conversation with in the world. For example, __leosmith__, the polyglot founder of [OPLingo](https://oplingo.com), can converse with a large part of the human race. (I have it on good authority that aliens have shortlisted him for abduction, brain-washing, and subsequent employment as an ambassador to humans... he had it coming). 

But what if you're just starting on your journey as a polyglot, only see languages as tools, and want to adopt the most efficient approach to your language-learning career? Surely you would want to learn the languages spoken by the most people, but also capitalize on people's proficiency in other languages. For example, if you're going to Canada, you could say that speaking English mostly covers it, so there's no need to speak French. You would lose out on a lot of things, but if you see language-learning as a purely utilitarian endeavour then this would be a valid decision. 

Anyway, how will you go about deciding which languages to learn? Well, we're going to help you out on this journey. 

You're welcome.
